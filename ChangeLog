	* NEWS: Moved contents of ChangeLog here.
	* src/Displayer.cxx: Removed call to glutDestroyWindow, as the window
	is already being cleaned up automatically once the program exists.
	* src/Makefile.am, src/gtk-gui/Makefile.am: Removed linking with the
	Xmu library, since we don't seem to use it anywhere.
	* src/*: Cleaned up most occurances of "using namespace std;". Also
	made sure that each module includes its own header first, in order to
	ensure that no header silently depends on another header to be
	included first.
	* src/Game.h: Removed definition of max since it conflicts with the
	definition of std::max.
	* src/sstream.h: Removed this file since it was only solving a
	compatibility issue for old versions of MSVC. Modern compilers should
	support the sstream header fine.
