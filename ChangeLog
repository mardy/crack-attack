	* NEWS: Moved contents of ChangeLog here.
	* src/Displayer.cxx: Removed call to glutDestroyWindow, as the window
	is already being cleaned up automatically once the program exists.
	* src/Makefile.am, src/gtk-gui/Makefile.am: Removed linking with the
	Xmu library, since we don't seem to use it anywhere.
